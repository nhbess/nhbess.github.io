Some time ago I wrote a program for visualizing search algorithms in a grid. A relatively simple [Breadth first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)that mutate its color on each search depth over a grid.

Nice plots. Extremely slow.

So I tried to rewrite it in a more efficient fashion, but somewhere on the process I made a mistake in the code, and there it was: an unexpected fractal suddenly appeared.
